Virtual Key for Your Repositories

Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. hired you as a Full Stack Developer. They aim to digitize their products and chose LockedMe.com as their first project to start with. You’re asked to develop a prototype of the application. The prototype of the application will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for the budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you’re asked to present the following in the next 15 working days (3 weeks)

Project Details:

2nd Sprint
Create a Java class for Option to delete the user-specified file from the application with case sensitivity.
Create a Java class for exit from the application.
Create the Main Java class as a welcome class to Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context.
Push the Java class in the git repository.

Unique Selling Points of the Application
The application is designed to keep on running and taking user inputs even after exceptions occur.
To terminate the application, an appropriate option needs to be selected.
The application can take any file/folder name as input. Even if the user wants to create a nested
Folder structure: the user can specify the relative path, and the application takes care of creating the required folder structure.
User is also provided the option to write content if they want into the newly created file.
The user is able to seamlessly switch between options or return to the previous menu even after any required operation like adding, searching, or deleting files is performed.
The application is designed with modularity in mind. Even if one wants to update the path, one can change it through the source code. Application has been developed keeping in mind that there should be very less “hardcoding” of data. 
Thank you!
